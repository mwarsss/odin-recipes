    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li> sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and the salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).</li>
        <li>Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling. </li>
    </ol>
